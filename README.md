iracing-minimal-style
=================

iRacing's site has a bit too many pieces of flair.   Let's minimize the distractions and soften the style.

# Forums
- decreases header
- removes image based curves on borders/buttons/etc
- removes background
- shrinks up a bunch of unused space
- shrinks author details on every post (leaving name pronounced)
- imposes smaller max height on signatures
- removes gradients and fades for a flat look

# Member site
- Removes left/right background images (promotions)
- Removes ticker
- Removes big footer (not the nav, the black mostly unused footer)
- Removes the facebook publish icon

# Installation
For those of you that don't use it, I recommend the chrome extension Tampermonkey by Jan Biniok. It makes it easy to add userscripts and also triggers updating them when they are listed on userscripts.org (which this one is). You may use this script with or without it, but I do recommend it.
