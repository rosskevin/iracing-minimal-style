iRacing's site has a bit too many pieces of flair.   Let's minimize the distractions.

# Installation
For those of you that don't use it, I recommend the chrome extension Tampermonkey by Jan Biniok. It makes it easy to add userscripts and also triggers updating them when they are listed on userscripts.org (which this one is). You may use this script with or without it, but I do recommend it.

# Userscripts.org
